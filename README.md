The article that I chose is ["At More Retailers, Algorithms Are Deciding What’s for Sale"](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/at-more-retailers-algorithms-are-deciding-whats-for-sale/) written by Marc Bain and published in Business of Fashion. The article talks about how online retail fashion brands are using machine learning to automate their tasks, such as reorders, to help them minimize their losses.

The article explains that the platform/software works by monitoring the transactions and behavior at the level of individual items across the brand's stores. It uses an algorithm to predict how many units should be reordered, how is the demand for each item, and many other useful data, providing a user-friendly dashboard or converting to spreadsheets if necessary. This software has been helping online retail stores to cut their losses because they are able to order a minimum stock and reorder only if necessary, which also impacts the amount of sales that said online retail store will have.
